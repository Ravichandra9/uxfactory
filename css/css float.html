      Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.[1] His
      mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam.[2] His father, Gurunath
      Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was
      raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's
      low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house
      in Dombivli, only during weekends.[3] He has a younger brother, Vishal
      Sharma.[4] Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money.
      Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school to Swami
      Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket
      facilities were better than those at Sharma’s old school. Sharma
      recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship.
      So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[4]
      Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed
      his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the
      innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket
      tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.[5] Youth and
      domestic first-class career Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone
      against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in March 2005.
      Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3
      wickets with 24 balls remaining. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja
      made their debuts in the same match.[6] It was Sharma's unbeaten innings
      of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College
      Ground in Udaipur in the same tournament that brought him into the
      limelight.[7] He visited Abu Dhabi and Australia with the India A squad
      and was then included among India's 30-member probables list for the
      upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he did not make the
      final squad.[8] Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New
      Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He scored 57 and 22 as India won by 3
      wickets.[9] He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006–07
      season and scored 205 off 267 balls against Gujarat.[10] Mumbai went on to
      win the tournament with Sharma scoring a half-century (57) in his second
      innings in the final against Bengal.[11] Sharma has spent his entire
      domestic first-class career at Mumbai. In December 2009, he made his
      highest career score of 309 not out in the Ranji Trophy against
      Gujarat.[12] In October 2013, upon the retirement of Ajit Agarkar, he was
      appointed team captain ahead of the 2013–14 season.[13]
